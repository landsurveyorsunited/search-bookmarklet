Bookmarklet by JavaScript


What is that Bookmarklet in JavaScript ? <br/>
[Bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) - is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands to extend the browser's functionality.

First time when I saw this I was very excited. What it that, JavaScript in **href** attribute, asked myself ! )<br/>
Guys who tell me that is old version to include JavaScript for **html** tags. <br/>
But, when I read more about that I thought and decided that it very cool think.<br/>
And I decided to create **Search Bookmarklet**.<br/>

#### What functionality "Bookmarklet Search" have:
- you may select any text on page and you should see button "Search". When you have click to "Search" you will go to another page where your text open in **google/search**.
